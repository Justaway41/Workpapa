                                <p className="small">
                                    These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions that would give rise to the substitiave law of another jurisdiction. Any disputes arising under or related in any way to these Terms, the Site, or any Services shall be resolved solely through binding arbitration in New York County, New York, in accordance with the provisions below.

                                <h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE; CLASS ACTION WAIVER. </h3>


                                <p className="small"><strong>Please read the following carefully. It affects your rights.</strong></p>
                                <p className="small">Most problems that users encounter can be resolved quickly and to a user&apos;s satisfaction by contacting us at support@workapa.com. You and Workpapa each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Workpapa shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.  The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
                                <p className="small">Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and by agreeing to arbitration, you and Workpapa waive the right to a judge or jury. Instead, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator to decide the dispute, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.  An arbitrator also must follow these Terms and Conditions as a court would.  You have the right to opt-out of this Agreement to Arbitrate (as explained below), which means that you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>
                                <p className="small">For the purpose of this provision, &quot;Workpapa&quot; means Workpapa and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents. The term &quot;Dispute&quot; means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Workpapa regarding any aspect of your relationship with Workpapa, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability, or scope of this provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).  &quot;Dispute&quot; is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Workpapa&apos;s licensors, suppliers, dealers, or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>
                                <p className="small">WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>
                                <p className="small"><strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong></p>
                                <p className="small">If you have a Dispute with Workpapa, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute before filing an arbitration claim (or any other legal proceeding if you elect to violate the obligation to arbitrate your Dispute). You do that by sending a notice to support@workpapa.com.  That notice must include (1) your name, (2) your address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if not apparent from the sent email), (3) a description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you are asking for.  If Workpapa does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your notice, you may pursue your Dispute through arbitration.  You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
                                <p className="small"><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong></p>
                                <p className="small">If this Section applies and the Dispute is not resolved through Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution (above), then either you or Workpapa may initiate arbitration proceedings.</p>
                                <p className="small">The American Arbitration Association (the &quot;AAA&quot;) or JAMS will arbitrate all Disputes.  For arbitration before AAA, the AAA&apos;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes existing as of the time of the filing of the arbitration will apply.  The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures existing as of the time of the filing of the arbitration will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.  This Section will control if it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.  Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
                                <p className="small">The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.  All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Section.</p>
                                <p className="small">To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Workpapa.  The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.  If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Workpapa may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Workpapa, subject to the arbitrator&apos;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.  Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Workpapa, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>
                                <p className="small"><strong>Arbitration Award</strong></p>
                                    The arbitrator will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the arbitration proceeding.  The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.  The arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.<p />
                                <p className="small"><strong>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong></p>
                                <p className="small">Workpapa will pay all arbitration filing fees and the arbitrator&apos;s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.  You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys&apos; fees or expert witness fees and expenses.  In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice to and negotiate in good faith with Workpapa as provided in the section above titled &quot;Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution&quot; and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney&apos;s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
                                <p className="small"><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
                                <p className="small">YOU AND WORKPAPA AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND WORKPAPA AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&apos;S OR PARTY&apos;S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER WORKPAPA USERS AND SHALL NOT BE ADMISSIBLE IN ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING.</p>
                                <p className="small">THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&apos;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  Neither you, nor any other user of the Site can serve as a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>
                                <p className="small"><strong>Jury Waiver</strong></p>
                                <p className="small">You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Workpapa are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.  In the absence of this Agreement to Arbitrate, you and Workpapa might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, those rights are waived.  Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
                                <p className="small"><strong>Severability</strong></p>
                                <p className="small">If any clause within this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section, and the remainder of this Section will be given full force and effect.  If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be unenforceable, this entire Agreement to Arbitrate will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>

                                <h3>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
                                <p className="small">

If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Company&apos;s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive the Company&apos;s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
