                                <p className="small"><strong>b. Use of Cookies</strong></p>
                                <p className="small">WorkPapa may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
                                <p className="small">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.</p>
                                <p className="small">WorkPapa reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into www.WorkPapa.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).</p>
                                <p className="small">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website.</p>

                                <h3>4. USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES</h3>
                                <p className="small">WorkPapa Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons â€“ sometimes also called single-pixel gifs â€“ that allow WorkPapa to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. WorkPapa may include Web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
                                <p className="small">Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. WorkPapa prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.</p>

                                <p className="small">We have not implemented any technology that would effectively recognize do not track signals and note that some content available on our Site is made available through relationships with third party providers who we do not control and who may collect and/or disclose personally identifiable information.</p>

                                <h3>7. HOW TO CORRECT OR UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

                                <p className="small">We use commercially reasonable procedures that are designed to protect the personal information in our custody and control that we collect from you against loss, theft and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have developed and implemented and continue to maintain and monitor a written information security program applicable to all records containing personal information. This security program is appropriate to the size, scope and type of our business, the resources available to us, the amount of stored data and the need for security and confidentiality of the personal information we store. No security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the security during transmission to us of the information you supply over the Internet. You can help us by taking precautions to protect your personal information when you are on the Internet and only disclose information that you want made public. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers and make sure to use a secure web browser.</p>

If you are under 13, please do not register for any of our services or provide us any information about yourself (such as your name, email address or phone number).</p>
